## rudamentary Cpp 11 implementation of JSON
### proof of concept solution
- works only with strings
- pretty inefficient storage of strings

### TODO
- rewrite with template class for more efficient storage of different data types
- rewrite using string_view or references
- split implementation into multiple files
